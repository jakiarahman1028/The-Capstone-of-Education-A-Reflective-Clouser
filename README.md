# The-Capstone-of-Education-A-Reflective-Clouser
From childhood through our journey to graduation, our education system often prioritizes  conformity over individuality. The project developed with OpenGL and in Visual Studio 2022  highlights the significance of having an educational system that places a strong emphasis on  originality, research, and critical thinking.

## 1.1 Problem Statement 
We have divided the project into six chapters which includes our educational journey from childhood to graduation and problems arise through the journey to achieve our goals. Kindergarten and primary levels are the foundation of academic activities of students and then they enter the secondary to higher secondary phase where they choose their interest of whether they want to take science, commerce or arts. Then we proceed to the graduation from universities with some traditional majors like medicine or engineering which are often unwanted by students. 

## 2.2 Workflow 
When launching the project, an introductory page displaying our project's title will precede the start of each chapter. To advance to the next page, users will need to press the 'N' key. Following that, a page providing an overview of the project's topic will follow. Subsequent pages dedicated to individual chapters can be accessed by pressing 'N' repeatedly." 

Chapter – 1: Kindergarten

Chapter – 2: Primary School 

Chapter – 3: High School

Chapter – 4: College

Chapter – 5: University

Chapter – 6: Workplace

Upon pressing 'N' again, the user will be directed to an epilogue page, and with another 'N' press, they will access the page that outlines the moral of our project. To exit the project, the user should press 'Q.' If the user wishes to navigate back, they can do so by pressing 'B.' Pressing 'B' allows the user to return to previous pages.
